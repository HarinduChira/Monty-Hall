# Monty Hall Paradox

## Overview

The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle based on the American television game show *Let's Make a Deal*. The game involves three doors, behind one of which is a car, and behind the other two are goats. The player picks a door, and then the host, who knows what is behind the doors, opens one of the other two doors to reveal a goat. The player is then given the option to change their choice of door.
