<p class="mt-4">The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle based on the 
    American television game show <em>Let's Make a Deal</em>. 
    The game involves three doors, behind one of which is a car, 
    and behind the other two are goats. The player picks a door, 
    and then the host, who knows what is behind the doors, opens 
    one of the other two doors to reveal a goat. The player is then
    given the option to change their choice of door.</p>
